Project: Air Quality

Domain Name: Environment Air quality

Abstract:
Contains the responses of a gas multi-sensor device deployed on the field 
in an Italian city. Hourly responses averages are recorded along with gas 
concentrations references from a certified analyser.

Dataset: Air quality of an Italian city
The dataset contains 65k+ instances of hourly averaged responses from 
an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality 
Chemical Multi-Sensor Device. The device was located on the field in a 
significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Data 
represents the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air 
quality chemical sensor devices responses. Ground Truth hourly 
averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, 
Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and were 
provided by a co-located reference certified analyser.
Evidences of cross-sensitivities as well as both concept and sensor drifts 
are present as described in De Vito et al., Sens. And Act. B, Vol. 
129,2,2008 (citation required) eventually affecting sensors concentration 
estimation capabilities. Missing values are tagged with -200 value

Objective:
So, we will predict the Relative Humidity of a given point of time based 
on the all-other attributes affecting the change in RH.
